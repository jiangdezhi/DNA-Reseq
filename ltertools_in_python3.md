## izip and imap
   
   Historical Note: 
   In Python 2, the built-in zip() and map() functions do not return an iterator, but rather a list. To return an iterator, the izip() and imap() functions of itertools must be used. In Python 3, izip() and imap() have been removed from itertools and replaced the zip() and map() built-ins. So, in a way, if you have ever used zip() or map() in Python 3, you have already been using itertools!
