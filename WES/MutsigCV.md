# MutsigCV 使用的注意事项
## 1. 错误：not enough mutations to analyze 是由于 “It seems that the minimum number of mutations required by mutsig is 50 silent and 50 nonsilent. If your data does not have that many variants then adding dummy silent and nonsilent variants might help. Make sure the dummy variants are not in the same genes as the original variants.”

  Silent mutations: are DNA mutations that do not significantly alter the phenotype of the organism in which they occur 不会对表型有改变的突变,可以发生在exon,发生在exon时一般是 synonymous mutations,也可以发生在intron。
  synonymous mutation: do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein. Only occur within exons, and are not always silent mutations.
  nonsilent muation: 
  missense mutation: is a point mutation that changes a codon to indicate a different amino acid. 
  nonsense mutation : same as stop gained , It's a point mutation that turns one codon into a stop codon. Nonsense mutations always result in the early termination of a polypeptide.
